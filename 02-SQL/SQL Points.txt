############ SQL ##############
Database will be created on one host (Physical/Virtual Machine) and runs on port 1521.
Database is nothing but SID (sdimprod,udimprod,orcl)
Database is segerated in to more granular in terms of Schemas (usa,scott,sales,risk)

The key difference is that RDBMS (relational database management system) applications store data in a tabular form, Normalised, tables have relations and support ACID properties.
DBMS applications store data as files data is not normalised, no relations, no ACID properties.

DDL    --> create, alter,rename,drop
DML   --> Insert, update,delete,merge     # commit is mandatory for DML for persistant data even for insert.
DQL   -->  select 
DCL    -->  grant , revoke
TCL     -->  commit, rollback, truncate (delete + commit)

# Exists example
select * from dept e where EXISTS (select * from emp d where e.deptno=d.deptno)
select * from dept e where NOT EXISTS (select * from emp d where e.deptno=d.deptno)

select * from emp where deptno in (10,20,NULL)               # out put records will be 10,20 
select * from emp where deptno NOT IN (10,20,NULL)     # NOT IN operator with Null will return empty output

delete from emp where deptno in (select deptno from emp group by deptno having count(*) <3)

# ANY, ALL used in conjuction with relational operator.
select * from emp where sal=any (1600,2000) ; select * from emp where sal>all (1600,2000)
select * from emp e join (select sal from emp where ename in ('JONES','SCOTT')) s on (e.sal>ALL s.sal)

# Order of execution in SQL query
distinct, from table1 join table2 on, where, group by, having, select, order by, limit.

SELECT * FROM EMP SAMPLE(10);                                            # 
# Scalar Functions are nothing but single row functions
# SQL Injection is nothing but attacking data base by inserting malicious select statements.
Nth higest salary
CTE (Common Table Expression)

# Sum of Positive and Negative Numbers from a column from a table.
select sum(case when x>0 then x else 0 end)sum_pos,sum(case when x<0 then x else 0 end)sum_neg from a;

# Query for non matching records between two tables.
select e.empno, e.deptno,d.DNAME from emp1 e left join dept1 d on(e.deptno=d.deptno) where d.DNAME is null order by 2
select * from dept e where NOT EXISTS (select * from emp d where e.deptno=d.deptno)

# Qurey for running totals

# Display 4th highest sal using CTE (common table expression)
with temp as (select * from emp  order by sal desc) 
select * from temp where rownum<=4 minus
select * from temp where rownum<=3

# Delet Nth records
select empno from emp where rownum<=10   (N)       -- empno comes from the first query
minus
select empno from emp where rownum<=9      (N-1)

# Delete duplicate rows from a table with out row id.
