# Data Structures in R.
# Data Structures are which holds group of values and can be iterated using for loop.
# Vectors-        1d, Homogenous
# Matrix-         2d, Homogenous
# List-           2d, Hetrogenous
# Data Frame-     2d
# Factors-        Way of handling categorical data
# Arrays-         Nd items
